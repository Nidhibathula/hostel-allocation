# Project Statement

## Problem Statement
Managing hostel room allocation manually is slow and often leads to errors.  
Students may be assigned wrong rooms, or data may get misplaced when handled on paper.  
The objective of this project is to automate the room allocation process using Java.

## Scope of the Project

- The system should take a student ID as input.
- It should check if the student exists in the system.
- If valid, the system should display the student's name and allocate an available room.
- If invalid, the program should show “Invalid Student ID”.
- The project covers basic object-oriented programming concepts in Java.

## Target Users
- Hostel office / wardens  
- Students  
- Educational institutions  

## High-Level Features
- Pre-stored list of students  
- Validation of student ID  
- Automatic room allocation  
- Display of room and student details
